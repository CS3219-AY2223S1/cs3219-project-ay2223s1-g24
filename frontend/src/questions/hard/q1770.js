The Number of Good Subsets</div>
********************************<div class="content__u3I1 question-content__JfgR"><div><p>You are given an integer array <code>nums</code>. We call a subset of <code>nums</code> <strong>good</strong> if its product can be represented as a product of one or more <strong>distinct prime</strong> numbers.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, if <code>nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]</code>:

	<ul>
<li><code>[2, 3]</code>, <code>[1, 2, 3]</code>, and <code>[1, 3]</code> are <strong>good</strong> subsets with products <code>6 = 2*3</code>, <code>6 = 2*3</code>, and <code>3 = 3</code> respectively.</li>
<li><code>[1, 4]</code> and <code>[4]</code> are not <strong>good</strong> subsets with products <code>4 = 2*2</code> and <code>4 = 2*2</code> respectively.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Return <em>the number of different <strong>good</strong> subsets in </em><code>nums</code><em> <strong>modulo</strong> </em><code>10<sup>9</sup> + 7</code>.</p>
<p>A <strong>subset</strong> of <code>nums</code> is any array that can be obtained by deleting some (possibly none or all) elements from <code>nums</code>. Two subsets are different if and only if the chosen indices to delete are different.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [1,2,3,4]
<strong>Output:</strong> 6
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The good subsets are:
- [1,2]: product is 2, which is the product of distinct prime 2.
- [1,2,3]: product is 6, which is the product of distinct primes 2 and 3.
- [1,3]: product is 3, which is the product of distinct prime 3.
- [2]: product is 2, which is the product of distinct prime 2.
- [2,3]: product is 6, which is the product of distinct primes 2 and 3.
- [3]: product is 3, which is the product of distinct prime 3.
</pre>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [4,2,3,15]
<strong>Output:</strong> 5
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The good subsets are:
- [2]: product is 2, which is the product of distinct prime 2.
- [2,3]: product is 6, which is the product of distinct primes 2 and 3.
- [2,15]: product is 30, which is the product of distinct primes 2, 3, and 5.
- [3]: product is 3, which is the product of distinct prime 3.
- [15]: product is 15, which is the product of distinct primes 3 and 5.
